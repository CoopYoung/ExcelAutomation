# ExcelAutomation
This is a project for Navistar Inc where I automate the Excel sheet generation for our workload projections. This involves OpenPyxl. 
Future goals for this is to scrape the data directly from the Master Build Ops Sheet. As of now, this is taking a copy of the Master Build Ops sheet, which needs to be redownloaded every week. 

The purpose of this program is to save time for Navistar management, as currently it is updated manually between the sheets.
